# The diagram above illustrates a multi-region, distributed architecture for a Kubernetes application designed to handle global traffic efficiently.

Users section
We have users from three different regions accessing the application.( Users located in the EU, US and Asia region.)

- Ingress:
  Ingress Controller: Acts as the entry point for all incoming traffic from users around the world. It routes traffic to the appropriate backend services based on rules.

- Load Balancer and Cloud CDN:
  Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services to ensure high availability and reliability.
  Cloud CDN: Provides a content delivery network to cache and deliver content to users with low latency by distributing it globally.

- Kubernetes Clusters:
  Kubernetes cluster is create and make it located in the three regions (United States, Asia and EU region).

- Application Pods:
  Application Pods: Instances of the application running within the Kubernetes clusters. Each region has its own set of application pods to handle local traffic, ensuring reduced latency and improved performance.

- Storage Buckets:
  Storage Bucket must be available in Multiple-Region as well
  A storage bucket located in the EU, US and Asia region that is used for storing data. Data is stored in region-specific storage buckets to ensure data locality, which helps in reducing latency and meeting data residency requirements.

===============================

- Monitoring and Logging
  These are essential for maintaining the health and performance of a Kubernetes cluster and its applications. They provide insights into system performance, resource usage, and help in diagnosing issues.
  This kubernetes application will be monitor and visualized with the popular tools Prometheus and Grafana. it will be deploy on kubernetes using Helm package manager. This setup provides comprehensive monitoring and logging for the Kubernetes clusters, helping to maintain its health and performance.
